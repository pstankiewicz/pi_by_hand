# Pi by hand
Pi calculation "by hand" with a "little" python help :)

This is very primitive solution of Leibniz algorithm. Described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80

Python calculates divisions, additions and substractions "by hand", it is unoptimized, very naive an inefficient... but lot of fun!

Long live the Pi!!! :)
